// Using what you learned so far about setTimeout,
// print the following 2 messages after their corresponding delays.

//     Print the message “Hello after 4 seconds” after 4 seconds
//     Print the message “Hello after 8 seconds” after 8 seconds.

// Constraints:
// You can define only a single function in your solution, which includes inline functions.
// This means many setTimeout calls will have to use the exact same function.
