/*
    - Create a Vehicle class that initializes `wheels` from the constructor 
    - Vehicle has an isMoving property that is false by default
    - Give vehicles the ability to `.startEngine()` and `.stopEngine()`:
        + If a vehicle's engine starts, `isMoving` property should set to true.
        + If a vehicle's engine stops, `isMoving` property should set to false.
    - Create another class called Bike that inherits from Vehicle and has 2 `wheels`
    - Create another class called Car that inherits from Vehicle and has 4 `wheels`
    - Create a new instance of Car and Bike classes and try to start and stop the engine and log the isMoving property
